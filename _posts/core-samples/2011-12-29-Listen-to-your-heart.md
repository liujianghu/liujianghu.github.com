演唱:Wild Rose
I know there's something in the wake of your smile.<br/>
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea.<br/>
You've built a love but that love falls apart.<br/>
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark.<br/>
Listen to your heart when he's calling for you.<br/>
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do.<br/>
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why,<br/>
but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.<br/>
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile.<br/>
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea.<br/>
They're swept away and nothing is what is seems,<br/>
the feeling of belonging to your dreams.<br/>
Listen to your heart when he's calling for you.<br/>
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do.<br/>
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why,<br/>
but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.<br/>
And there are voices that want to be heard.<br/>
So much to mention but you can't find the words.<br/>
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been when love was wilder than the wind.<br/>
Listen to your heart when he's calling for you.<br/>
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do.<br/>
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why,<br/>
but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.<br/>
Listen to your heart when he's calling for you.<br/>
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do.<br/>
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why,<br/>
but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.<br/>
